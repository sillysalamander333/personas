        The "Freestyle" branded drink kiosks aim to both increase drink options and simplify the process of drink vending in dining halls,   </br> reducing the need for different dispensers for different beverages with an all in one machine.</br>  </br> 

        Its drink selection screen is a digital, intuitive touch screen display 
        that presents an array of beverages to be selected from </br>  
        Once a drink is selected, a cup can be placed in the filling area </br> 
        A single button is push to start and operates the dispensing </br> 
        A lever in the back of the filling area controls the dispensing of ice along with the selected drink

    Most users have a similar experience in terms of the sequence of interactions with the interface: they select a drink from the screen, put the cup in the filling area, and then push the button to fill it. There was a consensus of positive experience with the speed and ease of use of the touch screen, but a couple of users noted that there was maybe too much choice and a reduction of drink options would make the selection experience smoother. Most thought it was intuitive to have a physical filling and ice dispensing mechanism rather than incorporating that into the screen, as it more closely resembles the standard design of simpler drink kiosks. Interestingly, a user pointed out a UI feature I had not known existed about the kiosk, a way to connect your mobile device via QR code and control the dispensing remotely. We agreed that it was on the less necessary side but could harbor benefits for public health in extreme measures, leaving us to assume it was likely implemented in response to the pandemic. </br></br></br>

    <b>User 1</b> </br>
    <ul>
      <li> I use it every day, I think, but I always just get water from it</li>
      <li> There are water fountains next to it but they're a lot slower</li>
      <li> I didn't even notice the ice thing until now</li>
      <li> It's great for when I'm in a hurry and need to refill my water bottle quick</li>

    </ul>
   </br> 
    <b>User 2</b></br> 
    <ul>
      <li> I'm trying to quit drinking soda but this isn't helping</li>
      <li> You can actually make it work with your phone, me and my friends used to mess with people </br> and connect from across the room, dispensing random drinks when people walked up to it </li>
      <li> I never know how hard to press on the ice part so I either get nothing or way too much</li>
      <li> I would add a way to control the ice from the screen</li>
      <li> Oh and maybe something that says if the syrup is low</li>


    </ul>
    </br>
    <b>User 3</b> </br> 
    <ul>
      <li> I don't really use it a lot I'm just in a hurry</li>
      <li> The water from it tastes kind of off so I usually use the fountains</li>
    </ul>
